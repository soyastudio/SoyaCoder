## Overview

- Traditional deployment era
- Virtualized deployment era
- Container deployment era:
    - Agile application creation and deployment: increased ease and efficiency of container image creation compared to
      VM image use.
    - Continuous development, integration, and deployment: provides for reliable and frequent container image build and
      deployment with quick and efficient rollbacks (due to image immutability).
    - Dev and Ops separation of concerns: create application container images at build/release time rather than
      deployment time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure.
    - Observability: not only surfaces OS-level information and metrics, but also application health and other signals.
    - Environmental consistency across development, testing, and production: runs the same on a laptop as it does in the
      cloud.
    - Cloud and OS distribution portability: runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, on-premises, on major public clouds, and
      anywhere else.
    - Application-centric management: raises the level of abstraction from running an OS on virtual hardware to running
      an application on an OS using logical resources.
    - Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services: applications are broken into smaller, independent
      pieces and can be deployed and managed dynamically â€“ not a monolithic stack running on one big single-purpose
      machine.
    - Resource isolation: predictable application performance.
    - Resource utilization: high efficiency and density

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes provides you with:

- Service discovery and load balancing
- Storage orchestration
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Automatic bin packing
- Self-healing
- Secret and configuration management
- Batch execution
- Horizontal scaling
- IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack
- Designed for extensibility

Kubernetes do not:

- Does not limit the types of applications supported
- Does not deploy source code and does not build your application
- Does not provide application-level services
- Does not dictate logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions. It provides some integrations as proof of concept, and
  mechanisms to collect and export metrics.
- Does not provide nor mandate a configuration language/system (for example, Jsonnet).
- Does not provide nor adopt any comprehensive machine configuration, maintenance, management, or self-healing systems.
- Additionally, Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system.

## [Cluster Architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/)

### Nodes

- workload: a workload is an application running on Kubernates
- control plane: The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy and manage the
  lifecycle of containers
- Pods: A pod represents a set of running containers in your cluster
- Kubelet: an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. I makes sure that containers are running in a pod.
- Container runtime interface (CRI): software that is responsible for running containers
- Kube-proxy: network proxy that runs on each node of the cluster

### Communication between Nodes and the Control Plane

#### Node to Control Plane

#### Control plane to node
- API server to kubelet
- API server to nodes, pods and services
- SSH tunnels
- Konnectivity service
