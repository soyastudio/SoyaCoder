## [Overview](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/overview)

### VPC networks

- A VPC network does the following:
    - Provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, including Google Kubernetes Engine (
      GKE) clusters, serverless workloads, and other Google Cloud products built on Compute Engine VMs.
    - Offers built-in internal passthrough Network Load Balancers and proxy systems for internal Application Load
      Balancers.
    - Connects to on-premises networks by using Cloud VPN tunnels and VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect.
    - Distributes traffic from Google Cloud external load balancers to backends.
- Firewall
- Routes
- Forwarding Rules
- Interfaces and IP addresses

### Networks and subnets

#### Subnets

Each VPC network consists of one or more IP address ranges called subnets. Subnets are regional resources, and have IP
address ranges associated with them.

[TOOL: CIDR to IPv4 Conversion](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/)

#### Types of subnet

- IPv4 only (single-stack) subnets, with only IPv4 subnet ranges
- IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack) subnets, with both IPv4 and IPv6 subnet ranges

#### Purposes of subnets

- Regular subnets: This is the default subnet type. Regular subnets are created by users or automatically created in
  auto mode networks to be used with VM instances. Regular subnets have a purpose of PRIVATE in the gcloud CLI or API.
  The purpose is None in the Google Cloud console.
- Private Service Connect subnets: A subnet to use to publish a managed service by using Private Service Connect.
- Proxy-only subnets: A proxy-only subnet to use with regional Envoy-based load balancers.
- Private NAT subnets: A subnet that is reserved for use as the source range for Private NAT. This subnet is set to
  --purpose=PRIVATE_NAT

#### IPv4 subnet ranges

- Valid IPv4 subnet ranges
- Prohibited IPv4 subnet ranges
- Unusable addresses in IPv4 subnet rangs
- Auto mode IPv4 rangs
- Additional consideration

#### IPv6 subnet ranges

- IPv6 specifications
- IPv6 range assignment

### Virtual machine instances

A Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance is a virtual machine that is hosted on Google's infrastructure. VM
instances include Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters, App Engine flexible environment instances, and other Google
Cloud products built on Compute Engine VMs.

### Specifications

- VPC networks, including their associated routes and firewall rules, are global resources. They are not associated with
  any particular region or zone.
- Subnets are regional resources.
- Each subnet defines a range of IPv4 addresses. Subnets in custom mode VPC networks can also have a range of IPv6
  addresses.
- Traffic to and from instances can be controlled with network firewall rules. Rules are implemented on the VMs
  themselves, so traffic can only be controlled and logged as it leaves or arrives at a VM.
- Resources within a VPC network can communicate with one another by using internal IPv4 addresses, internal IPv6
  addresses, or external IPv6 addresses, subject to applicable network firewall rules. For more information, see
  communication within the network.
- Instances with internal IPv4 or IPv6 addresses can communicate with Google APIs and services.
- Network administration can be secured by using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.
- An organization can use Shared VPC to keep a VPC network in a common host project. Authorized IAM principals from
  other projects in the same organization can create resources that use subnets of the Shared VPC network.
- VPC networks can be connected to other VPC networks in different projects or organizations by using VPC Network
  Peering.
- VPC networks can be securely connected in hybrid environments by using Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect.
- VPC networks support GRE traffic, including traffic on Cloud VPN and Cloud Interconnect. VPC networks do not support
  GRE for Cloud NAT or for forwarding rules for load balancing and protocol forwarding. Support for GRE allows you to
  terminate GRE traffic on a VM from the internet (external IP address) and Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect (internal IP
  address). The decapsulated traffic can then be forwarded to a reachable destination. GRE enables you to use services
  such as Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and SD-WAN.
- VPC networks support IPv4 and IPv6 unicast addresses. VPC networks do not support broadcast or multicast addresses
  within the network.

### Organization policy constraints

### Routes and firewall rules

#### [Routs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/routes)

- Routing in Google Cloud (routing table)
- Route types
    - System-generated default routes
    - Subnet routes
    - Dynamic routes: based on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
- Applicability and order
    - Applicable routes
    - Special return paths
    - Routing order
- Static Routess

#### Dynamic routing mode

Each VPC network has an associated dynamic routing mode that controls the behavior of all of its Cloud Routers. Cloud
Routers manage BGP sessions for Google Cloud connectivity products.

BGP Route Advertisement: BGP route advertisement refers to the process of broadcasting routing information to
neighboring routers. This is an important aspect of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used for exchanging
routing and reachability information among autonomous systems on the internet.

In a VPC network, a route consists of a single destination prefix in CIDR format and a single next hop. Next hop is a
routing term that refers to the next closest router a packet can go through. The next hop is among the series of routers
that are connected together in a network and is the next possible destination for a data packet. More specifically, next
hop is an IP address entry in a routerâ€™s routing table, which specifies the next closest/most optimal router in its
routing path. Every single router maintains its routing table with a next hop address, which is calculated based on the
routing protocol used and its associated metric.

#### Firewall rules

### Communications and access

- Communication within the network: (default-allow-internal rule)
- Internet access requirements
- Communications and access for App Engine
    - App Engine standard environment: Only App Engine firewall rules apply to ingress traffic. Because App Engine
      standard environment instances do not run inside your VPC network, VPC firewall rules do not apply to them.
    - App Engine flexible environment: Both App Engine and VPC firewall rules apply to ingress traffic. Inbound traffic
      is only permitted if it is allowed by both types of firewall rules. For outbound traffic, VPC firewall rules
      apply.
- Traceroute to external IP addresses
- Egress throughput limits
- Packet size

### Network performance

- Latency
- Packet loss


# [Cloud Router](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/concepts/overview)

## Cloud Router overview
Cloud Router is a fully distributed and managed Google Cloud service that uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to advertise IP prefixes. It programs dynamic routes based on the BGP advertisements that it receives from a peer. Instead of a physical device or appliance, each Cloud Router consists of software tasks that act as BGP speakers and responders. A Cloud Router also serves as the control plane for Cloud NAT. Cloud Router provides BGP services for the following Google Cloud products:
- Cloud Interconnect
- Cloud VPN, specifically HA VPN
- Router appliance (part of Network Connectivity Center)

### Specifications
- Autonomous system number (ASN)
- BGP peering addresses
- Access to internal load balancers
- IPv6 support

### Cloud Router software tasks

### Route advertisement modes
- Default advertisement mode
  - Regional dynamic routing mode
  - Global dynamic routing mode
- Custom advertisement mode

## [Best practices for Cloud Router](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/concepts/best-practices)
- If your on-premises Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) device supports Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), enable it on your on-premises BGP device and on the Cloud Router to provide a high-availability network link that can respond faster to link failures.
- If your peer router supports it, consider enabling MD5 authentication on your BGP sessions. By default, BGP sessions are unauthenticated.
- Enable graceful restart on your on-premises BGP device. With graceful restart, traffic between networks isn't disrupted in the event of a Cloud Router or on-premises BGP device failure as long as the BGP session is re-established within the graceful restart period.
- If graceful restart is not supported or enabled on your device, configure two on-premises BGP devices with one tunnel each to provide redundancy. If you don't configure two separate on-premises devices, Cloud VPN tunnel traffic can be disrupted in the event of a Cloud Router or an on-premises BGP device failure.
- For high reliability, set up redundant routers and BGP sessions even if your on-premises device supports graceful restart. In the event of non-transient failures, you are protected even if one path fails. For more information, see Redundant Cloud VPN tunnels.
- To use dynamic routing to connect your on-premises network to multiple Google Cloud projects, see the scenarios for VPC Network Peering and Shared VPC.
- To ensure that you do not exceed Cloud Router limits, use Cloud Monitoring to create alerting policies. For example, you can use the metrics for learned routes to create alerting policies for the limits for learned routes.
- If appropriate, you can manually configure custom learned routes and apply them to a BGP session. Custom learned routes can be helpful if you want to avoid the limitations of static routes. For example, static routes can't detect a loss of reachability in the next hop of a route. In contrast, custom learned routes can detect a loss of reachability, and they react accordingly to avoid dropping traffic without notification.
