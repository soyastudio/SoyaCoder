## Section 3: Deploying and implementing a cloud solution (~25% of the exam)

### 3.5 Deploying and implementing networking resources. Tasks include:

- Creating a VPC with subnets (e.g., custom-mode VPC, shared VPC)
- Launching a Compute Engine instance with custom network configuration (e.g., internal-only IP address, Google private
  access, static external and private IP address, network tags)
- Creating ingress and egress firewall rules for a VPC (e.g., IP subnets, network tags, service accounts)
- Creating a VPN between a Google VPC and an external network using Cloud VPN
- Creating a load balancer to distribute application network traffic to an application (e.g., Global HTTP(S) load
  balancer, Global SSL Proxy load balancer, Global TCP Proxy load balancer, regional network load balancer, regional
  internal load balancer)

## Section 4: Ensuring successful operation of a cloud solution (~20% of the exam)

### 4.1 Managing Compute Engine resources. Tasks include:

- Managing a single VM instance (e.g., start, stop, edit configuration, or delete an instance)
- Remotely connecting to the instance
- Attaching a GPU to a new instance and installing necessary dependencies
- Viewing current running VM inventory (instance IDs, details)
- Working with snapshots (e.g., create a snapshot from a VM, view snapshots, delete a snapshot)
- Working with images (e.g., create an image from a VM or a snapshot, view images, delete an image)
- Working with instance groups (e.g., set autoscaling parameters, assign instance template, create an instance template,
  remove instance group)
- Working with management interfaces (e.g., Google Cloud console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK)

### 4.2 Managing Google Kubernetes Engine resources. Tasks include:

- Viewing current running cluster inventory (nodes, pods, services)
- Browsing Docker images and viewing their details in the Artifact Registry
- Working with node pools (e.g., add, edit, or remove a node pool)
- Working with pods (e.g., add, edit, or remove pods)
- Working with services (e.g., add, edit, or remove a service)
- Working with stateful applications (e.g. persistent volumes, stateful sets)
- Managing Horizontal and Vertical autoscaling configurations
- Working with management interfaces (e.g., Google Cloud console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK, kubectl)

### 4.3 Managing Cloud Run resources. Tasks include:

- Adjusting application traffic-splitting parameters
- Setting scaling parameters for autoscaling instances
- Determining whether to run Cloud Run (fully managed) or Cloud Run for Anthos

### 4.4 Managing storage and database solutions. Tasks include:

- Managing and securing objects in and between Cloud Storage buckets
- Setting object life cycle management policies for Cloud Storage buckets
- Executing queries to retrieve data from data instances (e.g., Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Spanner, Datastore, Bigtable)
- Estimating costs of data storage resources
- Backing up and restoring database instances (e.g., Cloud SQL, Datastore)
- Reviewing job status in Dataproc, Dataflow, or BigQuery

### 4.5 Managing networking resources. Tasks include:

- Reserving static external or internal IP addresses
- Working with CloudDNS, CloudNAT, Load Balancers and firewall rules
