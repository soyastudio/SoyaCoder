# Chapter 3 Projects, Service Accounts, and Billing

## How GCP Organizes Projects and Accounts

### GCP Resource Hierarchy

- Organization
    - G Suite: Googleâ€™s office productivity suite (Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar...)
    - Cloud Identity (IDaaS)
        - A single cloud identity is associated with at most one organization
        - Super admins: assign the role of Organization Administrator Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to users
          who manage the organization. In addition, GCP will automatically grant Project Creator and Billing Account
          Creator IAM roles to all users in the domain
        - The users with the Organization Administrator IAM role are responsible for the following:
            1. Defining the structure of the resource hierarchy
            2. Defining identity access management policies over the resource hierarchy
            3. Delegating other management roles to other users
- Folder
- Project
    - It is in projects that we create resources, use GCP services, manage permissions, and manage billing options.
    - Anyone with the resourcemanager.projects.create IAM permission can create a project.
    - By default, when an organization is created, every user in the domain is granted that permission
    - Your organization will have a quota of projects it can create.

### Organization Policies

- Constraints on Resources
    - Allow a specific set of values
    - Deny a specific set of values
    - Deny a value and all its child values
    - Allow all allowed values
    - Deny all values
- Policy Evaluation
    - Policies are inherited and cannot be disabled or overridden by objects lower in the hierarchy, this is an
      effective way to apply a policy across all organizational resources.
    - Multiple policies can be in effect for a folder or project
- Managing Projects

## Roles and Identities

### Roles in GCP

- Primitive roles: owner, editor, viewer
- Predefined roles
- Custom roles

### Granting Roles to Identities

## Service Accounts

- Service accounts can be identities or treated as resource
- User-managed service accounts and Google-managed service accounts
- Service account group
- Service accounts are created automatically when resources are created

## Billing

### Billing Accounts

Billing account types:

- Self-serve:
- Invoiced: commonly used by enterprises and other large customers

Billing roles:

- Billing Account Creator, which can create new self-service billing accounts
- Billing Account Administrator, which manages billing accounts but cannot create them
- Billing Account User, which enables a user to link projects to billing accounts
- Billing Account Viewer, which enables a user to view billing account cost and transactions

### Billing Budgets and Alerts

### Exporting Billing Data

- Export to Big Query
- Export to Cloud Storage (File export): csv or json format

## Enabling APIs

GCP uses APIs to make services programmatically accessible. But you need enable it.

## Provisioning Stackdriver Workspaces

### Managing Projects

# Chapter 4 Introduction to Computing in Google Cloud

## Compute Engine

### Virtual Machine Images

- Public images by Google
- Public images by other providers
- Custom images

### Virtual Machines Are Contained in Projects

### Virtual Machines Run in a Zone and Region

consideration:

- Cost
- Data locality regulations
- HA
- Latency
- Need for specific hardware platforms, which can vary by region.

### Users Need Privileges to Create Virtual Machines

Predefined Roles:

- Compute Engine Admin
- Compute Engine Network Admin: can create, modify, and delete most networking resources, and it provides read-only
  access to firewall rules and SSL certifications
- Compute Engine Security Admin: create, modify, and delete SSL certificates and firewall rules.
- Compute Engine Viewer: can get and list Compute Engine resources but cannot read data from those resources

### Preemptible Virtual Machines

Limitation:

- May terminate at any time. If they terminate within 10 minutes of starting, you will not be charged for that time.
- Will be terminated within 24 hours.
- May not always be available. Availability may vary across zones and regions.
- Cannot migrate to a regular VM.
- Cannot be set to automatically restart.
- Are not covered by any service level agreement (SLA).

### Custom Machine Types

### Use Cases for Compute Engine Virtual Machines

- Choose the specific image to run on the instance.
- Install software packages or custom libraries.
- Have fine-grained control over which users have permissions on the instance.
- Have control over SSL certificates and firewall rules for the instance.

## App Engine

### Structure of an App Engine Application

- Application
- Services
- Versions
- Instances

### App Engine Standard and Flexible Environments

- Standard environment
    - First generation
    - Second generation
- Flexible environment
    - provides a fully managed PaaS and is a good option when you can package your application and services into a small
      set of containers. (like GKE)

### Use Cases for App Engine

## Kubernetes Engine

- Create clusters of VMs that run the Kubernetes orchestration software for containers
- Deploy containerized applications to the cluster
- Administer the cluster
- Specify policies, such as autoscaling
- Monitor cluster health

### Kubernetes Functionality

- Load balancing across Compute Engine VMs that are deployed in a Kubernetes cluster
- Automatic scaling of nodes (VMs) in the cluster
- Automatic upgrading of cluster software as needed
- Node monitoring and health repair
- Logging
- Support for node pools, which are collections of nodes all with the same configuration

### Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

### Kubernetes High Availability

### Kubernetes Engine Use Cases

## Cloud Functions

### Cloud Functions Execution Environment

- The functions execute in a secure, isolated execution environment.
- Compute resources scale as needed to run as many instances of Cloud Functions as needed without you having to do
  anything to control scaling.
- The execution of one function is independent of all others. The lifecycles of Cloud Functions are not dependent on
  each other.

### Cloud Functions Use Cases

-Internet of Things (IoT), in which a sensor or other device can send information about the state of a sensor. Depending
on the values sent, Cloud Functions could trigger an alert or start processing data that was uploaded from the sensor.

- Mobile applications that, like IoT apps, send data to the cloud for processing
- Asynchronous workflows in which each step starts at some time after the previous steps completes, but there are no
  assumptions about when the processing steps will complete

## Creating and Configuring Virtual Machines with Cloud SDK

### Creating a Virtual Machine with Cloud SDK

gcloud command:

- Compute Engine
- Cloud SQL instances
- Kubernetes Engine
- Cloud Dataproc
- Cloud DNS
- Cloud Deployment

```
gcloud compute

```

### Creating a Virtual Machine with Cloud Shell

## Basic Virtual Machine Management

### Starting and Stopping Instances

### Network Access to Virtual Machines

- SSH
- RDP

### Monitoring a Virtual Machine

### Cost of Virtual Machines

- VMs are billed in 1-second increments.
- The cost is based on machine type.
- Google offers discounts for sustained usage.
- VMs are charged for a minimum of 1 minute of use.
- Preemptible VMs can save you up to 80 percent of the cost of a VM.

## Guidelines for Planning, Deploying, and Managing Virtual Machines

- Choose a machine type with the fewest CPUs and the smallest amount of memory that still meets your requirements,
  including peak capacity. This will minimize the cost of the VM.
- Use the console for ad hoc administration of VMs. Use scripts with gcloud commands for tasks that will be repeated.
- Use startup scripts to perform software updates and other tasks that should be performed on startup.
- If you make many modifications to a machine image, consider saving it and using it with new instances rather than
  running the same set of modifications on every new instance.
- If you can tolerate unplanned disruptions, use preemptible VMs to reduce cost.
- Use SSH or RDP to access a VM to perform operating systemâ€“level tasks.
- Use Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, or Cloud SDK to perform VM-level tasks.

# Chapter 6 Managing Virtual Machines

## Managing Single Virtual Machine Instances

### Managing Single Virtual Machine Instances in the Console

- Starting, Stopping, and Deleting Instances
- Viewing Virtual Machine Inventory
- Attaching GPUs to an Instance
    - GPU Libraries have to be installed
    - The instance will run in a zone that has GPUs available
    - You will also need to customize the configuration for the machine type
    - Restrictions on the use of GPUs
        - CPU compatibility
        - Must set the instance to terminate during maintenance
- Working with Snapshots
    - Snapshots are copies of data on a persistent disk
    - When you first create a snapshot, GCP will make a full copy of the data on the persistent disk. The next time you
      create a snapshot from that disk, GCP will copy only the data that has changed since the last snapshot
    - To work with snapshots, a user must be assigned the Compute Storage Admin role.
    - Add label to a snapshot
- Working with Images.
    - Images can be created from the following:
        - Disk
        - Snapshot
        - Cloud storage file
        - Another image
    - Create an image
    - Delete an image
    - Deprecate an image:

```

### Instance Groups Load Balancing and Autoscaling

You can configure an autoscaling policy to trigger adding or removing instances based on CPU utilization, monitoring
metric, load-balancing capacity, or queue-based workloads.

## Guidelines for Managing Virtual Machines

- Use labels and descriptions.
- Use managed instance groups to enable autoscaling and load balancing
- Use GPUs for numeric-intensive processing, such as machine learning and high-performance computing.
- Use snapshots to save the state of a disk or to make copies.
- Use preemptible instances for workloads that can tolerate disruption

# Chapter 7 Computing with Kubernetes

## Introduction to Kubernetes Engine

### Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

- Cluster Master:
    - Kubernates API server
    - Controller
    - Scheduler
- Cluster Nodes

### Kubernetes Objects

- Pods
    - Pods contain at least one container
    - Multiple containers are used when two or more containers must share resources
    - Pods also use shared networking and storage across containers
    - Each pod gets a unique IP address and a set of ports, multiple containers in a pod connect to different ports and
      can talk to each other on localhost
    - Pods treat the multiple containers as a single entity for management purposes.
    - Pods are generally created in groups. Replicas are copies of pods and constitute a group of pods that are managed
      as a unit.
    - Pods support autoscaling as well.
    - Pods are considered ephemeral
    - Pods are usually managed by a controller
- Services: A service, in Kubernetes terminology, is an object that provides API endpoints with a stable IP address that
  allow applications to discover pods running a particular application.
- ReplicaSet: A ReplicaSet is a controller used by a deployment that ensures the correct number identical of pods are
  running
- Deployment: Deployments are sets of identical pods.
- StatefulSet
- Job

## Deploying Kubernetes Clusters

- Create credentials
- Create cluster

### Deploying Kubernetes Clusters Using Cloud Console
