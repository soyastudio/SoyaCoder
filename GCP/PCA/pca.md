## Analyzing Business Requirements

### Reducing Operational Expenses

- Managed Services: reduce the workload on systems administrators and DevOps engineers
- Preemptible VMs: a good option for batch processing and other tasks that are easily recovered and restarted
- Autoscaling: enables engineers to deploy an adequate number of instances needed to meet the load on a system

### Accelerating the Pace of Development
- Agile
- CI/CD
- Microservice architecture
- Lift and shift

### Reporting on Service-Level Objectives

```
 SLA/SLO/SLI
 
```

### Reducing Time to Recover from an Incident

### Improving Compliance with Industry Regulations
