# From Spring Framework to Spring Boot

## Overview

```pptx[Spring Boot Overview]
    1. The core of Spring Boot is Spring Framework;
    2. The core of spring framework is spring IoC container;
    3. Springframework includes codes which integrate most common used libraries into its IoC container;
    4. From Embedded Container to SpringBoot: 
        - Bootable
        - Easy to start with spring initializr
        - With aboundant spring-boot-starters, manage project made super easy
        - Change xml based configuration to annotation based configuration
        - Solved libraries' version conflictions

```

## Spring IoC Container

```pptx[Spring IoC Container]
    1. Simple Understanding: ApplicationContext
    2. More Details: 
        - Container and Components
        - POJO(Plain Old Java Object)
        - IoC(Inversion of Control) and Dependent Injection
    3. Deep understanding about ApplicationContext
    
```

### Container and Components

```pptx[Container and Components]
    1. Seperate business logic and low-level technical details such as security, transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, etc.
    2. Components focus on business logic;
    3. Containers prepare and provide low-level complex services for the components;
    4. Components deployed to container while container manages the lifecycle of components and provide related services to the components
    5. There are protocols between container and components
