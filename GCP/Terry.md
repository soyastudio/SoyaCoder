We as parents of Terry strongly believe that Terry will be a good candidate for the Spectrum program for the following reasons:
- Terry has demonstrated incredible ability to critical think via conversations with him as we believe the questions or topics he thinks about are beyond that of a 12 year old.
- We have never pushed Terry in regards to his academic studies as he takes full responsibility over his own academic success as shown in his report card.
- Terry is very independent and is skilled at research in finding his own answers.
- We believe that Terry is very skilled in working in a group environment and takes leadership during his time in his school’s basketball team along with working on group projects with his classmates.


3.  We believe that Terry will greatly benefit in his academic success as the spectrum program will put Terry at a higher standard compared to the normal classes.
- in this regard Terry will be in an environment of academically motivated students which in nature can push Terry further in his academic success.
- We strongly believe Terry will benefit greatly from the executive functioning development portion of the spectrum program.
- Terry can have a better opportunity to work with other students along with having better time management. This will have a greater impact down the road once Terry graduates high school and takes his first step into the real world.


4. As Terry is a very goal driven child, we do hope that teachers can work closely with him and to guide him in working towards his dream of becoming an architect.

5. We believe that Terry will transition very smoothly going from elementary school to high school for the following reasons:
- Although Terry has always achieved high performance via his academics, we as parents have never pushed him. Any extra-curricular activities or courses have been assigned via his personal request.
- We strongly believe that Terry has demonstrated strong time management skills as he is able to join multiple extra-curricular activities while keeping his academics up to date as well.
- Terry is very good at making friends and is a very nice boy; hence we strongly believe that he will be able to make many friends in secondary school

6. As Terry’s parents, we want to give our full support in supporting the spectrum program.
- we can attend any school events or volunteer opportunities provided to us
- Financial support via donations etc.

7. We have no concerns with our child attending any events as we have an older son who graduated from a similar program but at a different school.

8. So far we have no concerns and would like to provide full support
