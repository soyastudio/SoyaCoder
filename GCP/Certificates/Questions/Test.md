You are responsible for the user-management service for your global company. The service will add, update, delete, and
list addresses. Each of these operations is implemented by a Docker container microservice. The processing load can vary
from low to very high. You want to deploy the service on Google Cloud for scalability and minimal administration. What
should you do

1. Deploy your Docker containers into Cloud Run.
2. Start each Docker container as a managed instance group.
3. Deploy your Docker containers into Google Kubernetes Engine.
4. Combine the four microservices into one Docker image, and deploy it to the App Engine instance.

You are running several related applications on Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances. You want to follow
Google-recommended practices and expose each application through a DNS name. What should you do?

1. Use the Compute Engine internal DNS service to assign DNS names to your VM instances, and make the names known to
   your users.
2. Assign each VM instance an alias IP address range, and then make the internal DNS names public
3. Assign Google Cloud routes to your VM instances, assign DNS names to the routes, and make the DNS names public
4. Use Cloud DNS to translate your domain names into your IP addresses.

Your project team needs to estimate the spending for your Google Cloud project for the next quarter. You know the
project requirements. You want to produce your estimate as quickly as possible. What should you do?

1. Build a simple machine learning model that will predict your next monthâ€™s spend.
2. Estimate the number of hours of compute time required, and then multiply by the VM per-hour pricing.
3. Use the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator to enter your predicted consumption for all groups of resources.
4. Use the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator to enter your consumption for all groups of resources, and then adjust for
   volume discounts.
